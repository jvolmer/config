* Nice to have

** Direct way to open one of the emacs.org files

Perhaps same when using projectile C-c p p config/emacs/ (but is actually config dir)

** Run tests and code without prompt

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (defun my-projectile-run-project (&optional prompt)
    (interactive "P")
    (let ((compilation-read-command
           (or (not (projectile-run-command (projectile-compilation-dir)))
               prompt)))
      (projectile-run-project prompt)))
  
#+end_src
