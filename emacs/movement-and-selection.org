#+TITLE: Movement and Selection

* Movement

~f~ forward
~b~ backward
~n~ next
~p~ previous
~a~ start
~e~ end

** By column (character)  or line

*** left -right
| forward-char  | C-f |
| backward-char | C-b |

| move-beginning-of-line | C-a |
| move-end-of-line       | C-e |

*** up-down
| next-line     | C-n |
| previous-line | C-p |

| beginning-of-buffer | M-< |
| end-of-buffer       | M-> |

*** To specific line or colum
| goto-line      | M-g M-g |
| move-to-column | M-g TAB |

** By by larger text structures

*** Words
(hypens, points,... are seen as wordseparators)

| forward-word  | M-f |
| backward-word | M-b |

*** Paragraphs
any section of text that is separated by blank lines - see ~paragraph-start~ var

| forward-paragrph   | M-} |
| backward-paragraph | M-{ |

Behavior overwritten by org-mode
| org-forward-element  | M-} |
| org-backward-element | M-{ |

*** Sentences
see ~sentence-end~ var; if normal pattern aren't found it defaults to paragraph boundaries

| forward-sentence  | M-e |
| backward-sentence | M-a |

** By Pages

*** Scrolling PageUp and Down

| scroll-up-command   | C-v | to next page     |
| scroll-down-command | M-v | to previous page |

*** Centering point

| recenter-to-bottom | C-l   | puts point in the center of window |
|                    |       | cy: point at top - point at bottom |
| reposition-windw   | C-M-l | put whole block at point to center |

** By search

| isearch-forward  | C-s |
| isearch-backward | C-r |

Repeat it to move forward or backward to next finding

* Selection

point: location of cursor
mark: another location in file
region: selection of text, area between active mark and the point

| C-SPC or C-@ | set mark         |
| C-g          | cancel selection |

** Region
How to create a region:
- set active mark and move point
- hold shift and move point
- from deactivated mark to point: =C-x C-x=
- use mouse
- specialized marking commands

 Commands:
 =upcase-region= and =downcase-region= convert all characters to upper or lower case
 =eval-region= evaluate
 Have a look at all commands that end with =-region=

** Specialized Marking Commands
You can press them repeatedly to select more

| M-@     | mark-word      |                                                         |
| C-M-@   | mark-sexp      | set mark at end of current s-expression in Elisp buffer |
| M-h     | mark-paragraph |                                                         |
| C-M-h   | mark-defun     |                                                         |
| C-x h   | mark-buffer    |                                                         |

** Mark Ring
History list of all deactivated marks

Deactive mark
- Typing text
- Running editing command that affects the region
- =C-g=
- Instantly create deactivated mark with C-SPC C-SPC

Jump back to mark with =C-u C-SPC=
Will cycle through locations
You can set the number of locations that the kill ring stores with =mark-ring-max=, default 16 (=global-mark-ring-max=)

There is a local and a global mark ring, deactivating a mark in a buffer will write that to both rings
Jump back to mark in global ring with =C-x C-SPC= (=pop-global-mark=)
