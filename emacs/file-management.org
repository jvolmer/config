| % R | Rename based on regular expression                   |
|     | (e.g. ^test, old-\& -> test1.org to old-test1.org)   |
|     | could also use groups                                |

* Appearance

Add file icons

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  
  (use-package all-the-icons-dired
    :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode))
  
#+end_src

Don't show dotfiles

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (use-package dired-hide-dotfiles
    :hook (dired-mode . dired-hide-dotfiles-mode)
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map
                ("H" . dired-hide-dotfiles-mode)))
  
#+end_src

* Behavior

Stay in same buffer when using these bindings for navigation:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (use-package dired-single
    :commands (dired dired-jump)
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map
           ("h" . dired-single-up-directory)
           ("l" . dired-single-buffer)))
  
#+end_src

Open files with specific programs

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
        
        (use-package dired-open
          :commands (dired dired-jump)
          :custom
          (dired-open-extensions '(("png" . "feh")
                                   ("mkv" . "mpv")
                                   ("mp3" . "vlc")
                                   ("m3u" . "vlc")
                                   ("mp4" . "vlc"))))
        
#+end_src
