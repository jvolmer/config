Open

| C-x d       | Open dired (choose where) |
| C-x C-j (C) | Open dired in directory of current buffer |

*** Navigation

| k/j (C) | up/down (or n/p)                                |
| h/l (C) | go up/down in hierarchy (or ^/RET)              |
| g (C)   | go to specific file                             |
| o       | open buffer in another window                   |
| S-o     | open buffer in another window but dont focus it |
| v       | open buffer in view mode                        |
| i       | Show sub-dir at end of this buffer              |
| &       | Launch external program on file                 |

*** Mark

| m     | Mark a file                                  |

| *     | Mark with specific pattern, e.g.             |
|       | . for file extensions                        |
|       | / for directories                            |

*** View

| e (C) | dont show marked files                           |

| s     | toggle between alphabetic and dat/time order     |

*** Copying and renaming

Does not need marking

| Key | Description                                          |
|-----+------------------------------------------------------|

| R   | Rename / Move                                        |
| % R | Rename based on regular expression                   |
|     | (e.g. ^test, old-\& -> test1.org to old-test1.org)   |
|     | could also use groups                                |

If 2 windows are open, it defaults to copy to other open dired window folder

*** Deleting

| Key | Desciption                |
|-----+---------------------------|
| D   | Delete marked file        |
| d   | Mark file for deletion    |
| x   | Execute deletion of marks |

Set ~delete-by-moving-to-trash~ to true to move to trash instead of deleting

*** Archives

| Z | Compress or uncompress to .tar.gz                          |
| c | Compress selection to specific file (.zip will create zip) |

Modify zip command or add one more to list ~dired-compress-files-alist~

*** Others

| T       | Touch                                                 |
| M       | Change file mode (Interface not that good)            |

| G       | Change file group                                     |
| S       | Create symbolic link to this file                     |
| L       | Load an Emacs Lisp file into Emacs                    |
| C-x C-q | Edit dired buffer interactively                       |
|         | could then use normal search and replace for renaming |

** Appearance

Add file icons

#+begin_src emacs-lisp 
  
  (use-package all-the-icons-dired
    :hook (dired-mode . all-the-icons-dired-mode))
  
#+end_src

Don't show dotfiles

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (use-package dired-hide-dotfiles
    :hook (dired-mode . dired-hide-dotfiles-mode)
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map
                ("H" . dired-hide-dotfiles-mode)))
  
#+end_src

** Behavior

Stay in same buffer when using these bindings for navigation:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (use-package dired-single
    :commands (dired dired-jump)
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map
           ("h" . dired-single-up-directory)
           ("l" . dired-single-buffer)))
  
#+end_src

Open files with specific programs

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (use-package dired-open
    :commands (dired dired-jump)
    :custom
    (dired-open-extensions '(("png" . "feh")
                             ("mkv" . "mpv")
                             ("mp3" . "vlc")
                             ("m3u" . "vlc")
                             ("mp4" . "vlc")
                             ("doc" . "libreoffice")
                             ("xls" . "libreoffice")
                             ("odt" . "libreoffice")
                             ("ods" . "libreoffice"))))
  
#+end_src

* Ediff

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (use-package ediff
    :custom
    (ediff-split-window-function 'split-window-horizontally)
    (ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain))
  
#+end_src

Customize colors
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  
  (custom-set-faces
    '(ediff-current-diff-A ((t (:foreground "black" :background "SteelBlue1"))))
    '(ediff-current-diff-B ((t (:foreground "black" :background "SteelBlue1"))))
    '(ediff-fine-diff-A ((t (:foreground "black" :background "SlateBlue1"))))
    '(ediff-fine-diff-B ((t (:foreground "black" :background "SlateBlue1")))))
