#+TITLE: My Emacs Configuration

I followed [[https://github.com/daviwil][David Wilson]]'s [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ]["Emacs From Scratch" youtube series]] to create it, check it out if you are interested.

* Setup
For better readability, I wrote all configuration in org-files. Emacs needs its configuration written in elisp files. Evaluate the expression in [[file:main.org::Update config files][this section]] to create these elisp files automatically.
Currently this configuration expects this repository in the folder ~~/config/emacs/~.

** Install once
These are packages that you need to install upfront, eigther inside emacs or on your system

*** emacs
- transpose-frame
- =nerd-icons-install-fonts=

*** system
- Cantarell (=apt install fonds-cantarell=)
- Fira Code Retina (=apt install fonts-firacode=)
- ripgrep (=apt install ripgrep=)
